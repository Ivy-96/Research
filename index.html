               <h3>Background</h3><br><br>
            I graduated with a Bachelor of Technology (B. Tech.) in Biotechnology from Vellore Institute of Technology in 2017, after which I pursued a Master of Technology in Biomedical Engineering from Indian Institute of Technology Bombay. I graduated from the program in August 2019 and now work as a research assistant in the Psychophysiology Lab at IIT Bombay. <br><br>
            My interest in neuroscience developed towards the end of my Bachelor’s program. I decided to gain more interdisciplinary experience in laboratory techniques and in vitro research, focused on the mechanical and electrical behavior of cells. This was guided by the belief that it is difficult to engage strongly with the field of neuroscience without a grasp on the principles of mechanics and electricity. The program in biomedical engineering at IIT Bombay allowed me to explore new fields that connected biology to engineering, thus opening up a world of possibilities for enhancement of human health through unprecedented use of technology. For more details on my background, please take a look at <u><a href="https://ivy-96.github.io/Research/CV_Oct2019.pdf"  target="_blank">my CV.</u></a> <br><br>
            With a little practice, some luck, and a lot of support, I now have a strong grasp of neurobiology (especially at the cellular level) and am looking forward to applying this foundational knowledge to the field of cognitive neuroscience. My interests lie primarily in affective decision-making processes in the cognition of visual and literary art. </ol><br><br><br>

              <li>I am currently in the process of preparing a manuscript based on the work conducted during my Master’s program at IITB.<br><br><strong>Bhattacharya, I.</strong> (2019) Probing Cytoskeletal Changes in Neuronal Stem Cells due to Glucose Dysregulation. (Master of Technology). Indian Institute of Technology Bombay, Powai. Mumbai. India. <u><a href="https://ivy-96.github.io/Research/IIT Bombay Library Abstract.pdf"  target="_blank">(archived)</u></a> <u><a href="https://ivy-96.github.io/Research/Masters Thesis.pdf"  target="_blank">(full text)</u></a><br><br></li>
                Please contact the IIT Bombay Central Library for formal access to this document, or shoot me an <u><a href="mailto:ivy.bhattacharya@iitb.ac.in">email.</u></a><br><br>
               <li>At the Psychophysiology Lab, I am working on analyzing the control of saccadic eye movements during changing reading direction for a single word as in the case of reading numerals in Urdu.<br><br>
              If you are a native Urdu speaker who would like to volunteer for a study involving eye-tracking and EEG at IITB, if you would like to discuss this study in more detail, and if you have any ideas that you’re itching to share, please send me an <u><a href="mailto:ivy.bhattacharya@iitb.ac.in">email.</a></u></li><br><br>
             <br><br>
            If you would like to bounce off ridiculous and revolutionary ideas in cellular neuroscience, cell mechanics, cellular electricity, movement neuroscience, developmental neurobiology, cognitive neuroscience, heuristics, or even artificial intelligence, you are welcome to contact me over <u><a href="mailto:ivybhattacharya96@gmail.com">email</a></u>, or connect with me on <u><a href="https://twitter.com/iiivyii_B"  target="_blank">Twitter</a></u>!</ol>
